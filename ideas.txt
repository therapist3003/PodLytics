This file contains ideas that I thought of implementing regarding to Podcast Data

To-Do: Try to implement the following and add any new ideas

Can be implemented (with current knowledge)
1. Sentiment Analysis
2. Podcast - Genre Classification
3. Podcast - Popularity Prediction
4. Podcast Listeners Clustering - HeatMap Maybe

Cannot be implemented (or difficult):
1. Podcast transcription & summarization - Requires audio data(available but difficult to handle than text)
2. Speaker identification - Same as above
3. Podcast - Anomaly Detection

Refined Ideas:
1. Train model with summary & category from data.world episodes-sample.csv. Try to predict category.
   Example: Naive Bayes, SVM, LSTM, BERT
2. Lexicon-based Sentiment Analysis for summary column (Since summary is not labeled positive,negative etc.,)
   Example libraries: NLTK, VADER
3. Podcast genre classification (using summary, description and keywords)
   Feature Extraction - TF-IDF, Word2Vec, GloVe
   Algo - Multinomial Naive Bayes, SVM, DL LSTM, DL CNN
4. Check how to implement from popularity prediction
