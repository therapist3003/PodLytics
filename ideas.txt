This file contains ideas that I thought of implementing regarding to Podcast Data

To-Do: Try to implement the following and add any new ideas

Can be implemented (with current knowledge)
1. Sentiment Analysis
2. Podcast - Genre Classification
3. Podcast - Popularity Prediction
4. Podcast Listeners Clustering - HeatMap Maybe

Cannot be implemented (or difficult):
1. Podcast transcription & summarization - Requires audio data(available but difficult to handle than text)
2. Speaker identification - Same as above
3. Podcast - Anomaly Detection
